*TODO: update description with new services*
ChatPlug is a simple and extensible bridge between Facebook (Messenger), Discord and Telegram. Reclaim your privacy now, don't let Zuckbot spy on you  and drain your battery. :battery: :moneybag:

# :question: How does it work?

Everytime ChatPlug receives a message, it will be relayed to another chat on any configured platform. This way you don't have to install Facebook Messenger on your phone.

To use this you will need:
- Two Telegram accounts
   - Your main telegram account
   - A secondary account, which will be used by the bridge (unfortunately you will also need another phone number) 
- An API key for the second account https://core.telegram.org/api/obtaining_api_id
- Your Facebook account


# :electric_plug: Quick start

You can grab the binaries [here](https://github.com/feelfreelinux/ChatPlug/releases).


~~A configuration guide will run when you first start ChatPlug.~~ (TODO: remove strikethrough when ready)

# Custom build

ChatPlug now uses TypeScript on Node.js.

*TODO: Add instructions when ready*


On first run the program will create a file called `config.json` where you have to add your services.
