# :bridge_at_night: facegram

# :question: How does it work?
*TODO: update description with new services*
Everytime you receive a message on Messenger it will be relayed to a specific conversation on telegram. When you reply via Telegram the message will be relayed the other way round. This way you don't have to install Facebook Messenger on your phone.

To use this you will need:
- Two Telegram accounts
   - Your main telegram account
   - A secondary account, which will be used by the bridge (unfortunately you will also need another phone number) 
- An API key for the second account https://core.telegram.org/api/obtaining_api_id
- Your Facebook account


# :electric_plug: Quick start

You can grab the binaries HERE. *(TODO: Add link)*


~~A configuration guide will run when you first start facegram.~~ (TODO: remove strikethrough when ready)

# Custom build

Facegram now uses node (Typescript).

*TODO: Add instructions when ready*


TODO: add 
On first run the program will create a file called `config.json` where you have to add your services.
# :iphone: Usage

*TODO: update*
Everytime you receive a message on Facebook a new conversation with this person group will be created on telegram. However when you want to create the conversation manually you can message the bot with a `/import` command and the ID of the conversation (full help available with `/help`).
