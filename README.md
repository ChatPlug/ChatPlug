### *TODO: update description with new services*
ChatPlug is a simple and extensible bridge between Facebook (Messenger), Discord, Telegram and Slack.

# :question: How does it work?

Everytime ChatPlug receives a message, it will be relayed to another chat on any configured platform. This way you don't have to install Facebook Messenger on your phone.

# :electric_plug: Quick start

You can grab the binaries [here](https://github.com/feelfreelinux/ChatPlug/releases).


~~A configuration guide will run when you first start ChatPlug.~~ (TODO: remove strikethrough when ready)

# Custom build

ChatPlug now uses TypeScript on Node.js.



```

$ npm run build # production build (takes over a minute)
$ npm run start

```

```

$ npm run watch # development watch build (leave it in the background)
$ npm run start # run everytime you want to restart the app while developing

```

# :iphone: Usage
